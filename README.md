## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

### Continued development

- Semantic HTML

- Should have used the wave as the content of a before instead of an img tag.  The img is not seemless.  You see a line at the bottom of the  image on mobile.

- Srcset for mobile / desktop pictures.

- The light color on the section made it hard to layout.  Should have mocked it out in a darker color.  

- The hover color is off.  Should have used fill?

- Incomplete form.
